# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continuing my work on the Free Code Camp Calculator app. Added the keys and basic calculator functionality.

**Thoughts:** The only, or at least the absolute best, way to learn to code is to actually code. I've been spending probably 95% of my coding time reading, watching videos and following online courses. Time to code first and do online courses after. #100DaysOfCode sounds like a great plan.

### Day 2: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Added functionality to the calculator app. Validating input and adding keypad input. Passed all of the Free Code Camp tests. It still needs a little style, it's a bit boring looking right now.

**Thoughts**: Laid out the buttons using CSS Grid. How awesome is CSS Grid!
