# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continuing my work on the Free Code Camp Calculator app. Added the keys and basic calculator functionality.

**Thoughts:** The only, or at least the absolute best, way to learn to code is to actually code. I've been spending probably 95% of my coding time reading, watching videos and following online courses. Time to code first and do online courses after. #100DaysOfCode sounds like a great plan.

### Day 2: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Added functionality to the calculator app. Validating input and adding keypad input. Passed all of the Free Code Camp tests. It still needs a little style, it's a bit boring looking right now.

**Thoughts**: Laid out the buttons using CSS Grid. How awesome is CSS Grid!

### Day 3: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Played around with a weatherAPI from OpenWeatherMap.org using XMLHttpRequest. It was fun. Built a weather site based on a course from Pluralsight.

**Thoughts**: Need to work more with Axios, JQuery and Fetch to see why and when I would use one over the other.

### Day 4: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the FCC Calculator project. Added a backspace button and some formatting.

**Thoughts**: I need to practice, practice, practice. I am beginning to start to think in terms of Javascript solutions and slowly developing a sense of when to use certain methods over others.

### Day 5: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Life is already trying to get in the way of my 100 Days of Code. I was able to find an hour to get started on the Pomodoro project. Started working on the design and set up the React skeleton.

**Thoughts**: Tomato

**Link(s) to work**:  [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro) Just a basic create-react-app right now

### Day 6: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on the design for the FCC pomodoro project. Thought I would create a pie chart and animate it to create a count down graphic. Pie charts in CSS are not an simple topic. I found conic-gradient that would make the job easy but also found that only the latest versions on Chrome support it.

**Thoughts**: I will stick with my animated pie chart idea. Worst case I will do something else but learn a lot about CSS animations and SVG along the way.

### Day 7: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Finally have an animated pie chart thanks to Lea Verou and [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVnUDTtOLE0). Now to get this thing looking good and integrated into a pomodoro clock.

**Thoughts**: conic-gradient would have been much nicer.

### Day 8: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Free Code Camp Redux challenges today.

**Thoughts**: I feel like Redux is starting to make sense. Now I'll try to implement Redux in a project and quickly realize that I don't have a clue.

### Day 9: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working through Free Code Camp's React-Redux challenges. 

**Thoughts**: This may take creating a few projects to really start to get a feel for all the pieces.

### Day 10: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Free Code Camp React-Redux challenges. 

**Thoughts**: Yes, I completed the FCC React-Redux challenges but I definitely do not know React-Redux. I have learned enough to get started building a React-Redux test app. But I better start soon.

### Day 11: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Started digging in to D3.js. Not ready for that right now.

**Thoughts**: Need to make sure I have solid React knowledge before moving on to something as deep as D3

### Day 12: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Found a little time to make some progress on the Pomodoro clock project.

**Thoughts**: I am going to through everything in this project just to get a little experience. Experimenting with SVG for a count down timer and maybe SVG for increase / decrease buttons. Also going to try to add Redux even though that will be a little ridiculous in this tiny project.

### Day 13: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Added a couple SVG buttons to the pomodoro app. SVG is a bit of a challenge.

**Thoughts**: The first time I added font icons to a project it took about 1 minute to figure it out. SVG icons considerably more. Partly a JSX syntax thing so I can't totally blame SVG.

### Day 14: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Did a little reading on Axios and continued work on the pomodoro project.

**Thoughts**: I think I would like to give a little animation to the increase decrease buttons just to play with animating SVG elements.

### Day 15: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the animation for the pomodoro project. It's looking pretty good.

**Thoughts**: Getting CSS to do what you want can really eat up some time.

### Day 16: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added the timer function to the pomodoro app. Worked out a synchronization problem between the countdown timer and the animated graphic. Had to completely change the way the animation was timed. Removed CSS animation and went to setting the stroke-dasharray every second in JS.

**Thoughts**: It seems that you cannot count on a CSS keyframe animation to take the exact time specified. The pie chart animation would vary by up to 7 seconds for a 20 minute animation.

### Day 17: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: brought the pomodoro project up to fully functioning. Passiing all FCC tests.

**Thoughts**: Had to swap out the SVG buttons for some Fontawesome icons because it looks like the FCC tests did not see the SVG elements as 'clickable elements'.

### Day 18: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started comparing jQuery, Axios and Fetch.

**Thoughts**: Maybe just always use Axios. Need to experiment some more and become more comfortable with each.

### Day 19: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Putting the final touches on the pomodoro project. Created some React components where it seemed to make sense. Struggling with the 'easy' stuff; can't seem to format my settings labels and buttons as I would like and I spent way too long trying to get an alarm animation looking the just right.

**Thoughts**: CSS keyframes animations are great if you just want them to do what they are supposed to do. Trying to start and stop and animation so it only animates when you want is not too bad using animationPlayState unless you want the animation to stop at the end each time. Tried to add an event listener 'animationstart' and 'annimationend', no luck. Gave up on CSS animation and animated the graphic using JavaScript. Right? Wrong? Did I just miss the real answer? Maybe someday I'll find out.

### Day 20: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: spent some more time studying API calls. Began to transition the animation from CSS keyframes over to using JS. Needed to pause and restart the animation and I could not get CSS to pause at the same spot each time or pause and reset to start. JS works and is very controllable and repeatable.

**Thoughts**: CSS animations are quick and easy and smooth but probably shouldn't be messed with beyond what they were intended to do. Looks like I'm going to keep finding things to mess with on this pomodoro project. The 'professional' in me wants to fly through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum as fast as possible to get them done. I have to keep telling myself that the goal is to learn as much as possible and I should take more time at each step to get as much as I can out of the exercises.

### Day 21: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More code cleanup on the pomodoro project. Added a fade out/in on the title on change from session to break and back. Of course that broke the Free Code Camp tests so I have to add it as an option after startup.

**Thoughts**: Every day that I sit down to finish this project I decide to add features or tweak something to make it 'better.' I may never actually finish this project.

### Day 22: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Very little work on pomodoro. Did some study of basic Node.js and Express. Messing around with Postman.

**Thoughts**: Postman is unexpectedly awesome. I thought it was just a utility to send API requests. It is much much more. Excited to experiment further.

### Day 23: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: API weekend. Reading and experimenting with Postman.

**Thoughts**: Spending some time this weekend refactoring some apps to use Fetch, Axios and jQuery for API calls. Just want to get comfortable with all API calls.

### Day 24: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: After API weekend I am a lot more comfortable making API calls using fetch and jQuery. Also had a great time learning Postman and using the mock API server function. Good stuff.

**Thoughts**:  This API weekend worked so well I might try a theme for next weekend, maybe 'Redux Weekend.'

### Day 25: February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Did some research of Azure Web Apps and running Node.js on Azure. Continued my experimentation of various client API libraries.

**Thoughts**: Too much can go wrong with an API call.

### Day 26: February 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
