# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continuing my work on the Free Code Camp Calculator app. Added the keys and basic calculator functionality.

**Thoughts:** The only, or at least the absolute best, way to learn to code is to actually code. I've been spending probably 95% of my coding time reading, watching videos and following online courses. Time to code first and do online courses after. #100DaysOfCode sounds like a great plan.

### Day 2: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Added functionality to the calculator app. Validating input and adding keypad input. Passed all of the Free Code Camp tests. It still needs a little style, it's a bit boring looking right now.

**Thoughts**: Laid out the buttons using CSS Grid. How awesome is CSS Grid!

### Day 3: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Played around with a weatherAPI from OpenWeatherMap.org using XMLHttpRequest. It was fun. Built a weather site based on a course from Pluralsight.

**Thoughts**: Need to work more with Axios, JQuery and Fetch to see why and when I would use one over the other.

### Day 4: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the FCC Calculator project. Added a backspace button and some formatting.

**Thoughts**: I need to practice, practice, practice. I am beginning to start to think in terms of Javascript solutions and slowly developing a sense of when to use certain methods over others.

### Day 5: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Life is already trying to get in the way of my 100 Days of Code. I was able to find an hour to get started on the Pomodoro project. Started working on the design and set up the React skeleton.

**Thoughts**: Tomato

**Link(s) to work**:  [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro) Just a basic create-react-app right now

### Day 6: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on the design for the FCC pomodoro project. Thought I would create a pie chart and animate it to create a count down graphic. Pie charts in CSS are not an simple topic. I found conic-gradient that would make the job easy but also found that only the latest versions on Chrome support it.

**Thoughts**: I will stick with my animated pie chart idea. Worst case I will do something else but learn a lot about CSS animations and SVG along the way.

### Day 7: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Finally have an animated pie chart thanks to Lea Verou and [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVnUDTtOLE0). Now to get this thing looking good and integrated into a pomodoro clock.

**Thoughts**: conic-gradient would have been much nicer.

### Day 8: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Free Code Camp Redux challenges today.

**Thoughts**: I feel like Redux is starting to make sense. Now I'll try to implement Redux in a project and quickly realize that I don't have a clue.

### Day 9: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working through Free Code Camp's React-Redux challenges. 

**Thoughts**: This may take creating a few projects to really start to get a feel for all the pieces.

### Day 10: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Free Code Camp React-Redux challenges. 

**Thoughts**: Yes, I completed the FCC React-Redux challenges but I definitely do not know React-Redux. I have learned enough to get started building a React-Redux test app. But I better start soon.

### Day 11: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Started digging in to D3.js. Not ready for that right now.

**Thoughts**: Need to make sure I have solid React knowledge before moving on to something as deep as D3

### Day 12: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Found a little time to make some progress on the Pomodoro clock project.

**Thoughts**: I am going to through everything in this project just to get a little experience. Experimenting with SVG for a count down timer and maybe SVG for increase / decrease buttons. Also going to try to add Redux even though that will be a little ridiculous in this tiny project. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 13: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Added a couple SVG buttons to the pomodoro app. SVG is a bit of a challenge.

**Thoughts**: The first time I added font icons to a project it took about 1 minute to figure it out. SVG icons considerably more. Partly a JSX syntax thing so I can't totally blame SVG.

**Link(s) to work**: [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 14: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Did a little reading on Axios and continued work on the pomodoro project.

**Thoughts**: I think I would like to give a little animation to the increase decrease buttons just to play with animating SVG elements.

**Link(s) to work**: [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 15: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the animation for the pomodoro project. It's looking pretty good.

**Thoughts**: Getting CSS to do what you want can really eat up some time.

**Link(s) to work**: [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 16: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added the timer function to the pomodoro app. Worked out a synchronization problem between the countdown timer and the animated graphic. Had to completely change the way the animation was timed. Removed CSS animation and went to setting the stroke-dasharray every second in JS.

**Thoughts**: It seems that you cannot count on a CSS keyframe animation to take the exact time specified. The pie chart animation would vary by up to 7 seconds for a 20 minute animation.

**Link(s) to work**: [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 17: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: brought the pomodoro project up to fully functioning. Passiing all FCC tests.

**Thoughts**: Had to swap out the SVG buttons for some Fontawesome icons because it looks like the FCC tests did not see the SVG elements as 'clickable elements'.

**Link(s) to work**:  [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 18: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started comparing jQuery, Axios and Fetch.

**Thoughts**: Maybe just always use Axios. Need to experiment some more and become more comfortable with each.

**Link(s) to work**:

### Day 19: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Putting the final touches on the pomodoro project. Created some React components where it seemed to make sense. Struggling with the 'easy' stuff; can't seem to format my settings labels and buttons as I would like and I spent way too long trying to get an alarm animation looking the just right.

**Thoughts**: CSS keyframes animations are great if you just want them to do what they are supposed to do. Trying to start and stop and animation so it only animates when you want is not too bad using animationPlayState unless you want the animation to stop at the end each time. Tried to add an event listener 'animationstart' and 'annimationend', no luck. Gave up on CSS animation and animated the graphic using JavaScript. Right? Wrong? Did I just miss the real answer? Maybe someday I'll find out.

**Link(s) to work**: [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 20: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: spent some more time studying API calls. Began to transition the animation from CSS keyframes over to using JS. Needed to pause and restart the animation and I could not get CSS to pause at the same spot each time or pause and reset to start. JS works and is very controllable and repeatable.

**Thoughts**: CSS animations are quick and easy and smooth but probably shouldn't be messed with beyond what they were intended to do. Looks like I'm going to keep finding things to mess with on this pomodoro project. The 'professional' in me wants to fly through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum as fast as possible to get them done. I have to keep telling myself that the goal is to learn as much as possible and I should take more time at each step to get as much as I can out of the exercises.

**Link(s) to work**: [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 21: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More code cleanup on the pomodoro project. Added a fade out/in on the title on change from session to break and back. Of course that broke the Free Code Camp tests so I have to add it as an option after startup.

**Thoughts**: Every day that I sit down to finish this project I decide to add features or tweak something to make it 'better.' I may never actually finish this project.

**Link(s) to work**: [Pomodoro repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/FCC-Pomodoro)

### Day 22: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Very little work on pomodoro. Did some study of basic Node.js and Express. Messing around with Postman.

**Thoughts**: Postman is unexpectedly awesome. I thought it was just a utility to send API requests. It is much much more. Excited to experiment further.

### Day 23: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: API weekend. Reading and experimenting with Postman.

**Thoughts**: Spending some time this weekend refactoring some apps to use Fetch, Axios and jQuery for API calls. Just want to get comfortable with all API calls.

### Day 24: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: After API weekend I am a lot more comfortable making API calls using fetch and jQuery. Also had a great time learning Postman and using the mock API server function. Good stuff.

**Thoughts**:  This API weekend worked so well I might try a theme for next weekend, maybe 'Redux Weekend.'

### Day 25: February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Did some research of Azure Web Apps and running Node.js on Azure. Continued my experimentation of various client API libraries.

**Thoughts**: Too much can go wrong with an API call.

### Day 26: February 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More fun with API calls. Digging in more deeply with jQuery and Axios.

**Thoughts**: Axios is definitely my favorite and will be my go to for upcoming projects.

### Day 27: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still messing with API calls. Accessed some Fortnite data for the boy and some YNAB data for me.

**Thoughts**: I just want to master dealing with API calls since they are so important.

### Day 28: February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did a little coding.

### Day 29: February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JSON APIs and Ajax module in Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: Axios wins

**Link(s) to work**: [FreeCodeCamp/MikeDeGan](https://www.freecodecamp.org/mikedegan)

### Day 30: February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More development of the YNAB API project.

**Thoughts**: This will be a perfect data set to apply D3 to once I start the D3 lessons.

### Day 31: February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Pomodoro clock project. Achieved the Free Code Camp Front End Libraries Certification.

**Thoughts**: I seem to struggle with anything CSS including Bootstrap. It looks so easy and seems very easy to understand and then my fields are all over the screen.

### Day 32: February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started digging in to Node.js and Express today.

**Thoughts**: This is going to be fun.

### Day 33: February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Express js. So far so good.

**Thoughts**: Off to a good start. Express makes the code nice and clean. At least I feel like I understand what's going on, we'll see.

### Day 34: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: An intro to some templating engines, Pug, Handlebars and EJS.

**Thoughts**: This looks like another one of those things that seems kind of straight forward at first but I'm afraid it could get weird fast and possibly seriously complicate debugging.

### Day 35: February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More Node.js today. routing with Express, rendering ejs pages. And setting up the project as MVC.

**Thoughts**: Things move so slow when you have to learn every part of the project.

**Link(s) to work**: [Udemy Node Project. Github repo.](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/Udemy-NodeMax)

### Day 36: February 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More Node / Express. 

**Thoughts**: Excellent Node course on Udemy [Nodejs - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-the-complete-guide)

### Day 37: February 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Node / Express. Review routing and MVC.

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 38: February 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Node / Express. Started a new project with a React front end and Node server. A service request app. with form submittals and status tracking.

**Thoughts**: Very excited to use React and Node in an actual project.

### Day 39: February 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on menu design on the front end of the service request app.

**Thoughts**: Loving Materialize.

### Day 40: February 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not much time today. Spent a little more time on the Nodejs course.

**Thoughts**: Will need to review all of the code so far to make sure I know what's going on. I want to make sure I have a solid understanding of MVC and routing with Express.

**Link(s) to work**: [Node Course Repo](https://github.com/MikeDeGan/Udemy-NodeMax)

### Day 41: February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Review of routing with Express.

**Thoughts**: Very little coding time today.

### Day 42: February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning about dynamic routes with Express and ejs templates. also started learning about implementing MySql in Node.

**Thoughts**: Routing and MySql should keep me busy for the next few days.

### Day 43: March 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Some more time on the design of the service request app.

**Thoughts**: Just wish I had more time to dedicate to coding.

### Day 44: March 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent a bit of time on the service request app, developing the menu system.

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 45: March 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Back to Node.js. Review of section 8 of "Nodejs The Complete Guide". Adding more routes and page templates to the project.

**Thoughts**: This Maximilian Schwarzmuller does make a good course.

### Day 46: March 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Passing parameters with Express routes.

**Thoughts**: To pass them in using ejs. ```<a href="/products/<%= product.id %>" class="btn">Details</a>``` then to  capture them in the controller ```const prodId = req.params.productId;```

### Day 47: March 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not much time today. Adding some more routes and pages to the Node project.

### Day 48: March 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added a RegEx page to my documentation site.

**Thoughts**: Will need to do a second RegEx page with specific JavaScript examples.

### Day 49: March 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working through the Node-complete course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 50: March 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Some more dynamic routes. using params, queries and accessing body data.

**Thoughts**: 1/2 way through 100 days of code. That flew by.

### Day 51: March 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Learning Sequelize.

**Thoughts**: At first I thought 'just use SQL' but I can see how Sequelize can clean up the code and add some nice functionality and security.

### Day 52: March 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: started Mongodb work. Opened an Atlas account and established a connection with Nodejs.

**Thoughts**: I can see why developers like Mongo.

### Day 53 - 67: March 11 - 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've been coding everyday just not tweeting or logging progress here. Mostly been working on the Node course on Udemy. Learning and working with Mongo DB.

**Thoughts**: Mongodb will be perfect for the service request app. Each form will need to store different fields. A few key fields will be in all tables like User, Date Submitted, Form Name. With Mongodb I should only need one document to store everything. 

### Day 68: March 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a SQL db in Azure and connected to it with on-prem Nodejs server. Very excited to use this to report O365 license costs to each department.

**Thoughts**: Azure db's are awesome, easy, powerful and not cheap.

### Day 69-70: March 27-28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Beginning a project to send Office 365 user license assignments to an Azure SQL db on a monthly basis to be used to back bill departments. A Node server running on an Azure app service will read from that db. A react front end will report the data to the department users and allow them to view summary data and drill through for more detail. 

**Thoughts**: This project may be a little involved but I will give it a try. So far I have successfully pushed data from a PowerShell script to the Azure db, Read the DB from a Node app running on Azure. The communication flow and cloud configuration stuff seems to be in good shape all I have to do now is actually write the app.

### Day 71-92: March 29 - April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Office 365 billing app is very functional. 80% functionality has been added and tested.

**Thoughts**: This turned out to be a pretty good project to get my React and Node skills in shape. If I could have used a noSQL db the front end stuff would have been much easier.

### Day 93: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**:
