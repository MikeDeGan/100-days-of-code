# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continuing my work on the Free Code Camp Calculator app. Added the keys and basic calculator functionality.

**Thoughts:** The only, or at least the absolute best, way to learn to code is to actually code. I've been spending probably 95% of my coding time reading, watching videos and following online courses. Time to code first and do online courses after. #100DaysOfCode sounds like a great plan.

### Day 2: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Added functionality to the calculator app. Validating input and adding keypad input. Passed all of the Free Code Camp tests. It still needs a little style, it's a bit boring looking right now.

**Thoughts**: Laid out the buttons using CSS Grid. How awesome is CSS Grid!

### Day 3: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Played around with a weatherAPI from OpenWeatherMap.org using XMLHttpRequest. It was fun. Built a weather site based on a course from Pluralsight.

**Thoughts**: Need to work more with Axios, JQuery and Fetch to see why and when I would use one over the other.

### Day 4: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the FCC Calculator project. Added a backspace button and some formatting.

**Thoughts**: I need to practice, practice, practice. I am beginning to start to think in terms of Javascript solutions and slowly developing a sense of when to use certain methods over others.

### Day 5: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Life is already trying to get in the way of my 100 Days of Code. I was able to find an hour to get started on the Pomodoro project. Started working on the design and set up the React skeleton.

**Thoughts**: Tomato

### Day 6: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on the design for the FCC pomodoro project. Thought I would create a pie chart and animate it to create a count down graphic. Pie charts in CSS are not an simple topic. I found conic-gradient that would make the job easy but also found that only the latest versions on Chrome support it.

**Thoughts**: I will stick with my animated pie chart idea. Worst case I will do something else but learn a lot about CSS animations and SVG along the way.

### Day 7: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Finally have an animated pie chart thanks to Lea Verou and [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVnUDTtOLE0). Now to get this thing looking good and integrated into a pomodoro clock.

**Thoughts**: conic-gradient would have been much nicer.

### Day 8: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Free Code Camp Redux challenges today.

**Thoughts**: I feel like Redux is starting to make sense. Now I'll try to implement Redux in a project and quickly realize that I don't have a clue.

### Day 9: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working through Free Code Camp's React-Redux challenges. 

**Thoughts**: This may take creating a few projects to really start to get a feel for all the pieces.

### Day 10: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Free Code Camp React-Redux challenges. 

**Thoughts**: Yes, I completed the FCC React-Redux challenges but I definitely do not know React-Redux. I have learned enough to get started building a React-Redux test app. But I better start soon.
