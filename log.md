# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continuing my work on the Free Code Camp Calculator app. Added the keys and basic calculator functionality.

**Thoughts:** The only, or at least the absolute best, way to learn to code is to actually code. I've been spending probably 95% of my coding time reading, watching videos and following online courses. Time to code first and do online courses after. #100DaysOfCode sounds like a great plan.

### Day 2: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Added functionality to the calculator app. Validating input and adding keypad input. Passed all of the Free Code Camp tests. It still needs a little style, it's a bit boring looking right now.

**Thoughts**: Laid out the buttons using CSS Grid. How awesome is CSS Grid!

### Day 3: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Played around with a weatherAPI from OpenWeatherMap.org using XMLHttpRequest. It was fun. Built a weather site based on a course from Pluralsight.

**Thoughts**: Need to work more with Axios, JQuery and Fetch to see why and when I would use one over the other.

### Day 4: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the FCC Calculator project. Added a backspace button and some formatting.

**Thoughts**: I need to practice, practice, practice. I am beginning to start to think in terms of Javascript solutions and slowly developing a sense of when to use certain methods over others.
